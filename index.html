    <ul>
     <li><strong>1986 -</strong> It all starts in Oakland, California when the band Sweet Children came around. Founded by childhood friends Billie Joe (singing and playing guitar) and Mike Dirnt (backup vocals and bass guitar), the drummer John Kiffmeyer aka Al Sobrante joined them later the year later.
     <li><strong>1987 -</strong> Sweet Children's first live performance that took place on October 17 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California.

Later this year, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Kiffmeyer left the East Bay area to attend University. The Lookouts drummer Tré Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent.
     <li><strong>1991 -</strong> Lookout! re-released <em>39/Smooth</em> as <em>1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours</em>, now including songs from the band's first two EPs <em>Slappy</em>, and <em>1,000 Hours</em>.

     <li><strong>1995 -</strong> <em>Dookie</em>'s follow up <em>Insomniac</em> came out in the Fall of this year, the songs were less poppy, faster and heavier than any of their previous work and, probably for this reason, not as commercially successful.
